## Imaging Seminar I
The seminar was meant to give an introduction into the analysis of images acquired from an unstained thin brain section using a polarimetric setup to determine the orientation of nerve fibers.

## Tasks
- characteristics of the images (e.g., size, bit depth, image type, data type) from the given data set
- fitting function that describes the intensity course
- Analysis of Images based on signals computed using Fourier transform and plotted its coresponding transmittance, direction, retardation)

## Necessary Software
- Fiji: <https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads>
- Python3 (>=3.6): <https://www.python.org/>
